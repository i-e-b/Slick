# Slick
A light-weight group communication tool [Experimental]

## To do
Immediate next steps:

* [x] Dynamic load/unload images
* [x] Multiple pages (target different folders)
  * [ ] import from old format
* [x] Change image file format, use larger tiles.
  * [ ] Packed single file format?

## Plan

* [ ] mediator endpoint (Azure func or similar? RabbitMQ?)
* [ ] peer-to-peer link up based on mediator?
* [ ] shared 'infinite whiteboard' inside group
  * [ ] 'strands' to loosely link conversations
  * [ ] 'bubbles' to tightly link conversations
  * [ ] a way to push off-topic or humourous chat aside without removing it
* [ ] peer-to-peer audio/video link
  * [ ] try the 3D CDF wavelet thing here?
* [ ] Non-euclidian surface -- as you scroll away, content is reduced but not hidden.
* [ ] Android client
