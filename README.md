# Slick
A light-weight infinite-whiteboard tool

## To do
Immediate next steps:

* [ ] Improve drawing quality on Winforms version
* [ ] Make sure 'undo' works well with stream-db
* [ ] Migrate the 'repeatable' palette from the UWP app over to Winforms
* [ ] Remove the UWP app, because UWP is so bad.
* [ ] Highlighting ink
* [ ] Bring the wavelet image code out to its own library and use that

## Possible features

* [ ] shared 'infinite whiteboard' inside group
  * [ ] 'strands' to loosely link conversations
  * [ ] 'bubbles' to tightly link conversations
  * [ ] a way to push off-topic or humourous chat aside without removing it
* [ ] peer-to-peer audio/video link
  * [ ] try the 3D CDF wavelet thing here?
* [ ] Non-euclidian surface -- as you scroll away, content is reduced but not hidden.
* [ ] Android client
